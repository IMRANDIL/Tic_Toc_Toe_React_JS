## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid or play against a computer-controlled opponent. The computer makes random moves after a delay, simulating a realistic gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Two-player gameplay:** Play against another player locally.
- **Computer player:** Play against a computer-controlled opponent (currently making random moves).
- **Score tracking:** Keep track of wins for both players.
- **Restart game:** Restart the game at any time.
- **Disable squares during computer move:** Prevent players from clicking on squares while the computer is making its move.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Open the game in your browser and enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Gameplay Instructions
- Click on any empty square to place your mark (X or O).
- Players take turns marking squares until one player wins or all squares are filled.
- To win, a player must get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
