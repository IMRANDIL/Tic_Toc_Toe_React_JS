## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all spaces are filled and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game ends in a draw.
